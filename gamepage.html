            <li>Know how to play before teaching.</li>
            <li>Allow your friends to touch the game's pieces.</li>
            <li>Say WHO we are, HOW we win, and WHY this game is fun.</li>
            <li>Use people's names when you give examples.</li>
            <li> Rehearse your explanation before people show up.</li>
            <li>Encourage and reward questions.</li>
            <li>Play a "fake" round to clear up misconceptions.</li>

        <h1>Games</h1>
        <p>Board games have always been a large part of my life.  Some of my earliest memories involve playing games with my siblings, and I haven't stopped playing since.</p>
        <p>I was ecstatic when I learned I could pursue a major at Georgia Tech which offered classes teaching me how to study and design these games once I entered the industry.</p>
        <p>Enrolling in the classes required for my major has placed me in an setting with people just as passionate as myself about this hobby, and I have learned a lot being around them.</p>

        <h2>All Time Favorites</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite board games, technically in order, but I'm sure this will change over time.</p>

    <div class="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>It was always a daydream of mine to design board and video games as a career, but until I came to Georgia Tech, I did not believe there was a concrete path towards this career.</p>
        <p>Now that I discovered Computational Media, I am doing everything in my power to learn how to refine my skills from my peers and instructors.</p>
        <p>It feels wonderful to be pursuing a major I am passionate about, and I haven't doubted it since switching.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Now that I have completed a majority of my core classes as a Computational Media student, my curriculum has become more specialized regarding subject matter.</p>
        <p>LMC 2410 was easily my favorite class I have taken at this institute.  Creating games and discussing their design never felt like work to me.</p>
        <p>CS 2340 forced me to become more adept at handling group tasks, and delegating assignments fairly and effectively.  This will undoubtedly benefit me once I begin my career.</p>
