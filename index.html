            <h1>Elliott Januzelli</h1>
            <h2>Bachelor's in Computational Media : Aspiring Game Designer</h2>
            <p>I am a third year undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>Within my major, I have elected to pursue the <span class="keyword">Games</span> and <span class="keyword">Media</span> threads.</p>
            <p>This site is intended to reflect my interest in the core concepts of my major, and how these interests have impacted my life both inside and outside of school. I hope to display my work in a way that reflects my passion for this field, and also to guide those with simiar interests towards the resources I have found useful.</p>
